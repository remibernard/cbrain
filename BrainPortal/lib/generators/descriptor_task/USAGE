Description:
  Generate a working CbrainTask template from a JSON descriptor. This template
  can be used as a working base for adding custom functionality to a CbrainTask
  beyond what is automatically generated by CBRAIN's descriptor integration
  mechanism.

  If no schema (--schema) is specified, CBRAIN's default JSON descriptor
  schema is used.

Example:

    rails generate descriptor_task ~/descriptors/my_tool.json

  will create:

    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/portal/my_tool.rb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/bourreau/my_tool.rb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/views/_task_params.html.erb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/views/_show_params.html.erb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/views/public/edit_params_help.html

  Note that the path component 'cbrain-plugin-local' is a name given to a
  dummy CBRAIN plugins package; feel free to rename it as needed.
