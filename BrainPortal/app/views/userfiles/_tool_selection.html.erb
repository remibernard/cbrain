   This panel allows you to launch the scientific tasks that have been made available
   to you. First, select the files you want to process in the table below using
   their checkboxes. Then select one of the tasks here. You will be presented
   with a new selection box allowing you to choose which Execution Server
   will process your task.
   </p>

   <p class="medium_paragraphs">
   Each task has its own preferences as to how many files it needs and what type
   they should be. Once the task has validated that you've selected the proper
   files to process, you'll be presented with a form where you can customize
   its scientific parameters.
